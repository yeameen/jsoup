This is a fork of wonderful html beautifier jsoup. The original jsoup works nicely to clean
the document based on the list of tags to retain. Yet sometimes I need just the opposite; list
the tags (or tag-attribute rule) which I want to make blacklisted and need removal. Seconly, sometimes
I need only to remove the tag but keeping all its children (now make them children of their grandparent ;-) ).
The extra feature I have added is to remove a dom element but keeping all its children intact.

Description from original project:

jsoup: Java HTML parser that makes sense of real-world HTML soup.

jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API
for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.

* parse HTML from a URL, file, or string
* find and extract data, using DOM traversal or CSS selectors
* manipulate the HTML elements, attributes, and text
* clean user-submitted content against a safe white-list, to prevent XSS

jsoup is designed to deal with all varieties of HTML found in the wild; from pristine and validating,
to invalid tag-soup; jsoup will create a sensible parse tree.

See http://jsoup.org/ for downloads and documentation.
